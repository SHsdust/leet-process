       *  @brief  Removes first element.
       *
       *  This is a typical %queue operation.  It shrinks the %queue by one.
       *  The time complexity of the operation depends on the underlying
       *  sequence.
       *
       *  Note that no data is returned, and if the first element&apos;s
       *  data is needed, it should be retrieved before pop() is
       *  called.
